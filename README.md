# Hello-Worldz
First repository on GitHub. So exciting. Let's learn my dude.

What is up my people,

My name is Zach Reider and I am currently a senior at Quincy University and I am majoring in Exercise Science and Biological Sciences. I thought I would try to join the computer science world and see if it's cut out for me. I am quite hopeful that eventually this will mostly make sense to me, if not I will just google eveything.

Toodalo my kangaroos.
